        <h1>Documentation</h1>

        <div id="DocumentBlock">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                If I had to choose one word to describe how I feel after this project, I would say "Satisfied". It was a lot of fun working on this project.
                At the beginning I had a lot of trouble working with PIXIJS, and I have a lot of complaints about the language, but overall what I ended up with
                is something I am proud to call my own.
            </p>
            <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>
                As I explained in my proposal, Neko Samurai is a endless runner, in which we fight your way and attempt to get as far as you can. I am happy with
                where I ended up. The only thing I was unable to implement was controls for moblie.<br>
                <br>
                Other than that, I was able to implement the basics of an endless runner like random generation of obstacle and health. I also was able to implement my 
                unique sword system that allows you to destroy 2 of the 3 possible obstacle you can encounter, as well as 3 obstacles that you will have to adapt around.<br> 
                <br>
                Other features including a paralax effect on the objects, meaning. objects in each lane move a different speed meaning you'll have to account for that when switching lanes.
            </p>

            <h2>My self analysis</h2>
            <p>
                I would say that out of the three projects I did this semester, this one I am the most proud of. This is the one that I would consider a portfolio piece.
                If I had to pick out something I would improve on I think it would definetly have to be my overall code struture. I think if I went in with a more concreate
                plan then the code would have turned out more organized that it is currently.
            </p>

        <h1>Neko Samurai: Undying Will (猫侍不滅の意志)</h1>

        <div id="MainBlock">
            <h2>High Concept</h2>
            <p>A side scrolling infinite runner, in which you use your reflexes to properly dodge each
            obstacle that appears in your way. As you get futher the challenge gets harder, but the 
            reward becomes more grandiose.
            </p>

            <h2>Genre</h2>
            <p>Action, Casual, Endless Runner</p>

            <h2>Platform</h2>
            <p>Desktop Web, (Mobile Web if I get the Time)</p>

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>You are Neko-Chan, as you run across the land of Japan to stop Kotei Inu and his evil reign.</p>

            <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>I want to go for an old Japanese astetic for the backgrounds mixed with an modern anime style
            for the assets and the characters.
            </p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The game will have very simple controls. The player can move up and down with either w and s,
            or up and down. If I can add moblie controls I would love to add swipe and tap controls.
            </p>
