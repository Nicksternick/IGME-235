    <h3>About the project</h3>
    <p>This project was interesting to say the least. Overall I am pretty happy with what I ended up with, though there is definetly a lot a learned and would do different in the future. <br>
    To start, this project uses Kanji API. Kanji API has an expansive index of every kanji, each one being able to be queried to get into on it's meaning, pronouciation and stroke count. <br>
    The Kanji API didn't actually have a way to get a random Kanji, so I had to code in a system that can take one of the many lists from the Kanji API and write in a method that would <br>
    get a random Kanji from the list and then querey the Kanji chosen. My web site has 4 Kanji search options. Getting a random Kanji, Search a Kanji, Saving a Kanji and searching a list. <br>
    On top of that, saving Kanji will put them into a library for easy access for the future, with two options to either search one up from the list or remove them from the list.</p>
    <p>The only external source that I used for this site was google fonts, for a more clean sans serif font. There's definetly a lot more that this website has potential for, but <br>
    due to other classes I am a shamed that I cannot go futher with this project. As for self evaluation, think I did a very good job in struturing the Javascript. There was a lot of <br>
    problem solving that was very enjoyable. The part I am not as proud of is the CSS, which I think could have been handled more efficently. Overall looking at the rubric I think my <br>
    project would score around a 90, there are flaws but overall I don't think those flaws outweight the achomplishments of this project.</p>
